        <h2>Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</h2>
        <p>Modals, or also known as overlays or dialog windows, are a common UI pattern used to simplify an interface and save screen real estate. Although it may be in theory very useful from a design perspective, many users now see modals as annoying and often dismiss them. If we follow best practices, then it will be useful to users in grabbing their attention or showing additional information. This includes giving the user a way to close the modal, proper labeling of action items, sizing and location, and following accessibility guidelines. It was interesting learning that modals are not often used on mobile, and that the example of a modal used by facebook used the width of the mobile device to ensure legibility.</p>

        <h2>Form Design</h2>
        <p>This <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">article</a> on form design covers best practices to improve form usability and brings many great insights. It is important to consider the usability of forms so that users are more likely to complete them, as from a business standpoint, forms are the first step of conversion. I was surprised to learn that inline labels were not best practice, as I have encountered many forms where most labels were inline. I thought it was important that the author touched on accessibility in the last tip. As product designers, we should not only design just for people with disabilities but for everyone regardless of their abilities so that we do not exclude any users who may have different capabilities. This means intentively designing things for simplicity, using familiar interactions to make complex tasks simple and straightforward to perform, and also for perceivableness, making sure all content can be perceived whether people use sight, hearing, or touch.</p>
