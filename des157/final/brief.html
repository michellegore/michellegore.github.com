        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>I will be developing my Mad Libs 2.0 project by expanding upon the content, iterating and further testing my designs, and by adding more interactions.</p>

        <h2>Comparison Project 1</h2>
        <p>This website has a fun color palette and typography. It is one of the most engaging online quizzes I have interacted with, as there are many motion and interaction design elements throughout the experience. It has very clear information hierarchy, making it easy and fun to learn and read through information. My favorite design solution in this website is that a “fun fact” icon randomly floats across the screen where users can choose or choose not to engage with it. There is also a nicely designed progress bar that lets the user know how much they have completed and how much left they have.</p>

        <h2>Comparison Project 2</h2>
        <p>It’s very interesting how this website uses the entire screen to fully engage the audience for every question and answer. It uses sound well in the full-screen videos, and it does well in providing information to the user about these videos. The users are able to mute or skip the video, and also how many more seconds are in the video. Although the colors and layout are relatively simple, it is very pleasing to look at especially with the small motion design elements.</p>

          <h2>Project Goals</h2>
          <p>My goal is to add more motion and interaction design in my project to make it more engaging for the user to go through. From the two comparison projects, I really like the idea of having each question and answer be a whole experience and I want to incorporate that into my own. I now also have inspiration on how I can format my form unconventionally and interesting, yet still clearly understandable. </p>

          <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
          <p>I plan on designing more graphics to tell a story with my Mad Libs 2.0 project. I will also redesign the form itself so that it is more engaging with each answer. I will be keeping the same typography and colors, as I feel it fits well with my idea. I will ensure that there is good white space in my project where the graphics and form will feel unified.</p>

          <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
          <p>With each answer, there will be an animated interaction that will occur. I will be adding more interactions when the user hovers over certain areas, such as having a different cursor of having graphics animate when they mouse over. I will also add user-controlled sounds, where the page will have a dog barking and panting sounds when the user interacts with the form.</p>

          <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
          <p>I want to make the experience very fun and engaging, and my end goal is to get people to enjoy it so much that they share the game with other people. Taking inspiration from the projects I compared above, Little interactions, sounds, motion, and hover states will turn this simple form into an interesting and enjoyable experience.</p>
