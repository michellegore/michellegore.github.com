        <h3>• OBSERVATIONS •</h3>
        <p>The user enjoyed playing the mad lib and laughed when reading the final story. For visuals, they liked the glass gradient effect behind the form but thought that the white text against the green background was difficult to read.</p>
        <img src="./images/screenshot1.png" alt="pic1">
        <p>They really liked the imagery and felt that it added value to the user experience. The background colors match the illustration style and make the overall site look cohesive, however, they thought that the border around the form didn’t match the style.</p>
        <img src="./images/screenshot2.png" alt="pic2">
        <p>They enjoyed the button hover states. The footer overlapped the imagery on their screen size, and the audio did not work. Overall, they said that the mad lib was very clear to use, and the information hierarchy was easy to follow.</p>

        <h3>• IMPLEMENTING FEEDBACK •</h3>
        <p>I plan to make the website overall more accessible by changing the green background to a darker green to make the white text more readable. I also want to add more animations, which the user suggested I could rotate the dog to make it look like it is doing a flip. I also plan to fix the audio and footer so that they work, as well as add some more imagery when the user clicks on surprise.</p>
